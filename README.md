# OnboardIQ test tasks

This is the repository for [OnboardIQ](https://onboardiq.com) test tasks.

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, React.js, all that jazz. One task per folder.
Check the `README` inside, ask your questions, make an estimation (date
and hours) — and good luck.

If you wish to fork the repository — sure, just please make sure your
fork is private.
